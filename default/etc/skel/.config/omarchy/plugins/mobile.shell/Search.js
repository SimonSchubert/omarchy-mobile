// The Settings tree, flattened and scored, for the drawer's search field.
// Ported from moarchy.settings/Search.js.
//
// spec/settings.md section O is the contract. In one sentence: typing in the app
// drawer searches this tree as well as the app catalogue, and a tap on a result
// goes to the row rather than to a screen two levels above it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why a walk and not a list
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There is exactly one place a settings action is declared, and it is PAGES.
// A second list -- a hand-written "things you can search for" table -- would be
// a list to forget to update, and the way you would find out is a row that works
// everywhere except in search. So the index is derived, and O3 asserts that
// every result names a page and row Settings can actually stand on.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What is not in it, and why that is structural
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A page may build its rows at open from a `provider`: the ~420 timezone cities,
// every installed font, every wallpaper in the theme, every live reminder, every
// plugin, every audio device, and now every theme's palette. None of those are
// in PAGES, so none of them can reach this index -- not because a filter drops
// them but because there is nothing here to walk. That is O10, and it is the
// reason a search for "e" comes back with a handful of rows rather than four
// hundred cities.
//
// `input` rows are skipped: "Minutes" and "Message" are the labels on two fields,
// not destinations, and the row that consumes them (Set a reminder) is indexed.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why the scoring bands are upstream's
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two lists are read as one screen, so they have to rank the same way. The
// bands below are AppSearch.js's (shell/services/AppSearch.js in the Omarchy
// shell): a name prefix beats an id prefix beats a substring, and inside a band
// the shorter label wins. Nothing here needs to match its numbers exactly -- the
// two lists are never merged -- but a query that puts "Screenshot" above "Screen
// record" in one and below it in the other reads as a bug.

// A row may also opt out by declaring `unlisted: true`, which the walk honours
// below. It exists for one shape: a nav row whose only destination is a page
// built by a `provider`.
//
// The paragraph above about providers says the ~420 timezone cities cannot
// reach this index because there is nothing here to walk. True -- but the
// eleven region rows that lead to them are declared, so they were indexed, and
// the result was that typing "a" answered Asia, Africa, Arctic and America:
// four of five slots spent on buckets whose contents are deliberately
// unsearchable. A row that can only take you to a list search cannot see is
// not a search result, it is scaffolding.
//
// Declared on the row rather than listed by page id here, because a page id in
// this file would be exactly the second list the essay at the top refuses.

// A row that needs a field filled in before it can act is findable but never
// first. "set reminder" matches both `tools.reminders.new/custom` -- the row at
// the bottom of the Set screen, inert until a duration is typed (J8) -- and
// `tools.reminders/new`, the screen that has the field. Untouched, the inert one
// won by two points on label length, so the best answer to "set reminder" was
// the one thing on the list that cannot set a reminder. O9 keeps it reachable
// and this keeps it second.
